# Illusionist JS

This is a custom WidgetManager that handles the client-only aspect of updating
the widgets.

The structure of the project is based on
[Voila JS](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila/tree/master/js)
and [@jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/tree/master/packages/jupyterlab-manager)
